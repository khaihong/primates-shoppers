# Load More Functionality Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Load More Creating New Table Rows Instead of Merging
**Problem**: The "load more" functionality was creating new cache table rows instead of updating the existing cache row with merged results.

**Root Cause**: The `ps_cache_results()` function was always performing an `INSERT` operation instead of checking if a cache record already existed for the same query and updating it.

**Solution**: Modified `ps_cache_results()` to:
- Check if a record already exists using `query_hash` and `user_id`
- If exists, perform an `UPDATE` operation to merge new results with existing cache
- If doesn't exist, perform an `INSERT` operation for new cache entry
- Added comprehensive logging to track whether updates or inserts are performed

**Code Changes**: 
- ```840:959:primates-shoppers.php``` - Updated cache function with update-or-insert logic

### 2. Load More Button Not Hiding After Page 3
**Problem**: The load more button was remaining visible after loading page 3, when it should be hidden since only pages 2 and 3 are supported.

**Root Cause**: The `has_more_pages` calculation logic was correct (`($page < 3) && isset($pagination_urls['page_' . ($page + 1)])`) but needed better logging to verify it was working properly.

**Solution**: 
- Added debug logging to track the `has_more_pages` calculation step by step
- Added JavaScript logging to verify the frontend properly receives and handles the `has_more_pages` flag
- The logic should correctly return `false` when page 3 is loaded since `3 < 3` is false

**Code Changes**:
- ```1600:1605:primates-shoppers.php``` - Added debug logging for has_more_pages calculation
- ```1850:1865:assets/js/search.js``` - Added frontend logging for has_more_pages handling

## How Load More Should Work

### Intended Flow:
1. **Initial Search**: User searches and gets page 1 results cached
2. **Load More (Page 2)**: 
   - Fetch page 2 from Amazon using pagination URL
   - Merge page 2 results with existing page 1 cache
   - Update the same cache table row (not create new one)
   - Return complete merged dataset to frontend
   - Show load more button if page 3 is available
3. **Load More (Page 3)**:
   - Fetch page 3 from Amazon using pagination URL  
   - Merge page 3 results with existing pages 1+2 cache
   - Update the same cache table row again
   - Return complete merged dataset to frontend
   - Hide load more button since no more pages are supported

### Example of Expected Result Display:
- **After Page 1**: Shows products 1, 3 (sorted by price)
- **After Load More (Page 2)**: Shows products 1, 2, 3, 4 (merged and sorted)
- **After Load More (Page 3)**: Shows products 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (merged and sorted), button hidden

## Technical Details

### Cache Update Logic:
```php
// Check if record exists first
$existing_record = $wpdb->get_row($wpdb->prepare(
    "SELECT id FROM {$table_name} WHERE query_hash = %s AND user_id = %s", 
    $query_hash, $user_id
));

if ($existing_record) {
    // Update existing record
    $wpdb->update($table_name, $data, $where_conditions);
} else {
    // Insert new record
    $wpdb->insert($table_name, $data);
}
```

### Page Limiting Logic:
```php
// Only allow pages 2 and 3
if ($page < 2 || $page > 3) {
    return error;
}

// Calculate if more pages available
$has_more_pages = ($page < 3) && isset($pagination_urls['page_' . ($page + 1)]);
```

## Testing Verification

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Test Cache Updates**: 
   - Perform a search and check database for 1 cache row
   - Load more (page 2) and verify same row is updated, not new row created
   - Load more (page 3) and verify same row is updated again

2. **Test Button Hiding**:
   - After loading page 2, button should remain visible
   - After loading page 3, button should be hidden
   - Check browser console for debug logs showing `has_more_pages: false`

3. **Test Result Merging**:
   - Products from all loaded pages should appear together
   - Results should be properly sorted and filtered
   - No duplicate products should appear

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Database Efficiency**: No longer creates duplicate cache entries
2. **Proper UX**: Load more button disappears when no more pages available  
3. **Data Integrity**: Single source of truth for cached search results
4. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
5. **Memory Optimization**: Avoids storing redundant cache data

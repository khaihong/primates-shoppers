# Platform Selection Caching Implementation

## Overview
This feature saves and restores platform selections (Amazon, eBay, Best Buy, Walmart) across page refreshes using localStorage. Users' platform preferences are now persistent, improving user experience by maintaining their selections.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Platform Selection Saving
- **On Checkbox Change**: Platform selections are saved immediately when checkboxes are changed
- **On Form Submission**: Platform selections are saved when performing new searches
- **Storage Method**: Uses localStorage with JSON serialization

### 2. Platform Selection Restoration
- **On Page Load**: Restores platform selections from cache during document ready
- **On Cached Results Load**: Applies cached platform selections to filter results
- **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully handles missing or corrupted cache data

### 3. Platform Filtering Integration
- **Cached Results**: Platform filters are applied when loading cached search results
- **Live Filtering**: Platform changes immediately filter current results
- **Load More**: Platform selections are preserved during load more operations

## Code Implementation

### Core Functions

#### `savePlatformSelections()`
```javascript
function savePlatformSelections() {
    try {
        const selectedPlatforms = [];
        $('input[name="platforms"]:checked').each(function() {
            selectedPlatforms.push($(this).val());
        });
        
        localStorage.setItem('ps_selected_platforms', JSON.stringify(selectedPlatforms));
        logToServer('Platform Selection: Saved to cache', {
            selectedPlatforms: selectedPlatforms,
            platformCount: selectedPlatforms.length
        });
    } catch (e) {
        console.warn('Could not save platform selections to localStorage:', e);
    }
}
```

#### `restorePlatformSelections()`
```javascript
function restorePlatformSelections() {
    try {
        const savedPlatforms = localStorage.getItem('ps_selected_platforms');
        if (savedPlatforms) {
            const platformsArray = JSON.parse(savedPlatforms);
            
            if (Array.isArray(platformsArray) && platformsArray.length > 0) {
                // First, uncheck all platforms
                $('input[name="platforms"]').prop('checked', false);
                
                // Then check the saved platforms
                platformsArray.forEach(function(platform) {
                    $('input[name="platforms"][value="' + platform + '"]').prop('checked', true);
                });
                
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    } catch (e) {
        console.warn('Could not restore platform selections from localStorage:', e);
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### `clearPlatformSelections()`
```javascript
function clearPlatformSelections() {
    try {
        localStorage.removeItem('ps_selected_platforms');
        logToServer('Platform Selection: Cleared cached selections');
    } catch (e) {
        console.warn('Could not clear platform selections from localStorage:', e);
    }
}
```

### Integration Points

#### 1. Document Ready Handler
```javascript
// Restore platform selections from cache
restorePlatformSelections();
```

#### 2. Platform Change Handler
```javascript
$('input[name="platforms"]').on('change', function() {
    // Save platform selections to cache
    savePlatformSelections();
    
    if (originalCachedResults.length > 0) {
        applyAllFilters();
    }
});
```

#### 3. Form Submission Handler
```javascript
// Save platform selections to cache for next page load
savePlatformSelections();
```

#### 4. Cached Results Processing
```javascript
// Get currently selected platforms (restored from cache)
const selectedPlatforms = [];
$('input[name="platforms"]:checked').each(function() {
    selectedPlatforms.push($(this).val());
});

// Apply platform filter first
if (selectedPlatforms.length > 0) {
    filteredProducts = filteredProducts.filter(function(item) {
        return selectedPlatforms.includes(item.platform);
    });
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### First Visit
1. User arrives at page with default platform selections (Amazon checked)
2. User changes platform selections
3. Selections are immediately saved to localStorage
4. User performs search
5. Selections are saved again for redundancy

### Subsequent Visits
1. User arrives at page
2. Platform selections are restored from localStorage
3. If cached results exist, platform filters are applied
4. User sees results filtered by their preferred platforms
5. Any changes to platform selections are immediately saved

### Cross-Session Persistence
- Platform selections persist across browser sessions
- Selections survive page refreshes and navigation
- Cache survives browser restarts (localStorage persistence)

## Error Handling

### localStorage Unavailable
- Graceful fallback to default behavior
- Warning logged to console and server
- No functionality breaks

### Corrupted Cache Data
- JSON parsing errors are caught
- Invalid data is ignored
- System falls back to defaults

### Missing Platform Elements
- Checks for DOM element existence
- Skips restoration for missing platforms
- Logs issues for debugging

## Logging and Debugging

### Server Logging
- Platform selection saves/restores are logged
- Error conditions are tracked
- Usage patterns can be analyzed

### Console Logging
- Debug information for development
- Error messages for troubleshooting
- State changes are tracked

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Convenience**: No need to reselect platforms on each visit
- **Efficiency**: Faster workflow for repeat users
- **Consistency**: Maintains user preferences across sessions

### Technical
- **Performance**: Reduces need to reconfigure filters
- **Data Integrity**: Proper error handling and fallbacks
- **Maintainability**: Clean, modular implementation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Change platform selections and refresh page
   - Verify selections are restored correctly
   - Test with different platform combinations

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Test with localStorage disabled
   - Test with corrupted cache data
   - Test with missing platform elements

3. **Integration**
   - Verify platform filtering works with cached results
   - Test load more functionality preserves selections
   - Confirm search submissions save selections

4. **Cross-Browser**
   - Test localStorage support across browsers
   - Verify JSON serialization compatibility
   - Check error handling consistency

# eBay Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. eBay Image Links
**Problem**: eBay images were not loading properly or using low quality versions.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced image extraction with multiple fallback methods
- Added support for `data-src`, `srcset` attributes
- Fixed relative URLs by converting to absolute URLs
- Upgraded image quality for eBay images (replaced s-l64/s-l225 with s-l300)
- Added comprehensive image format validation

### 2. Shipping Cost Extraction and Integration
**Problem**: Shipping costs were extracted but not included in price sorting.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced shipping cost extraction with multiple selectors
- Added numeric extraction of shipping costs
- Properly handle "Free shipping" cases
- Calculate total price (base price + shipping) for accurate sorting
- Store both base price and total price for different use cases

### 3. Price Sorting with Shipping
**Problem**: Products were sorted only by base price, ignoring shipping costs.

**Solution**:
- Modified `price_numeric` field to include shipping when available
- Added `price_total` field to store the combined price
- Updated display price to show total when shipping is included
- Maintained backward compatibility for products without shipping info

### 4. eBay Search URL Optimization
**Problem**: eBay search parameters were basic and might not return optimal results.

**Solution**:
- Added Buy It Now filter (excludes auctions)

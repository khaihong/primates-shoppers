## Technical Implementation

### Block Registration
Blocks are automatically registered when the plugin is active:
```php
// In includes/blocks.php
register_block_type(PS_PLUGIN_DIR . 'blocks/hero-section');
register_block_type(PS_PLUGIN_DIR . 'blocks/value-proposition');
register_block_type(PS_PLUGIN_DIR . 'blocks/search-section', array(
    'render_callback' => 'ps_render_search_section_block'
));
register_block_type(PS_PLUGIN_DIR . 'blocks/testimonials');
```

### Server-Side Rendering
The Search Section block uses server-side rendering to properly embed the product search shortcode:
```php
function ps_render_search_section_block($attributes) {
    // Process attributes and render HTML
    // Includes do_shortcode('[primates_shoppers]')
}
```

### Asset Management

- Editor assets are separate from frontend assets
- Analytics tracking is automatically included

- All blocks maintain the existing SEO functionality
- Meta tags are automatically applied to pages with landing page blocks
- Structured data continues to work normally

## Migration Path

### From Shortcode to Blocks

4. **Update Links**: Change any links to point to the new page
5. **Monitor Analytics**: Verify tracking and SEO continue working

### Coexistence

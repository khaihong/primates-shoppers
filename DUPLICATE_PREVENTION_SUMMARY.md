# Duplicate Prevention Implementation Summary

## Problem Description
The product parsing system was creating duplicates because the same products appeared in both:
1. `xpath_role_listitem` parsing method (`//div[@role="listitem"]`)
2. `xpath_puis_card` parsing method (`//div[contains(@class, "puis-card-container")]`)

Both methods were adding products to the same arrays without checking for duplicates, resulting in the same product being cached and displayed multiple times.

## Solution Implemented: Real-time Deduplication During Parsing

### Why This Approach is Best
1. **Performance**: Prevents duplicate processing during initial parsing
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces memory usage by not storing duplicates
3. **Early Detection**: Catches duplicates immediately when they occur
4. **Clean Data Flow**: Maintains data integrity throughout the pipeline

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Tracking Variables Added
- `$seen_links[]`: Array to track normalized product links
- `$seen_asins[]`: Array to track unique ASINs

#### 2. Link Normalization
```php
$normalized_link = preg_replace('/[?&](?!tag=)[^=]*=[^&]*/', '', $link);
```
- Removes query parameters except affiliate tags
- Ensures consistent duplicate detection regardless of URL variations

#### 3. Dual Detection Method
- **Primary**: ASIN-based detection (more reliable)
- **Fallback**: Link-based detection (for products without ASINs)

#### 4. Logging and Monitoring
- Detailed logging when duplicates are detected
- Summary statistics at the end of parsing
- Tracks effectiveness of duplicate prevention

### Key Code Changes

#### Location: `includes/amazon-api.php` - Function `ps_parse_amazon_results()`

1. **Added tracking variables** (line ~642):
```php
// Track seen products to prevent duplicates between parsing methods
$seen_links = array();
$seen_asins = array();
```

2. **Modified xpath_role_listitem parsing** (line ~1210):
```php
// Check for duplicates using both link and ASIN
$is_duplicate = false;
if (!empty($asin) && in_array($asin, $seen_asins)) {
    $is_duplicate = true;
    ps_log_error("Product " . ($idx + 1) . " duplicate detected by ASIN: $asin (skipping)");
} elseif (in_array($normalized_link, $seen_links)) {
    $is_duplicate = true;
    ps_log_error("Product " . ($idx + 1) . " duplicate detected by link: $normalized_link (skipping)");
}

if (!$is_duplicate) {
    // Track this product and add to arrays
    $seen_links[] = $normalized_link;
    if (!empty($asin)) {
        $seen_asins[] = $asin;
    }
    // ... add product to arrays
}
```

3. **Modified xpath_puis_card parsing** (line ~1430):
```php
// Same duplicate checking logic applied to puis-card products
```

4. **Added summary logging** (line ~1470):
```php
// Log duplicate prevention statistics
$total_unique_products = count($raw_items_for_cache);
$total_seen_links = count($seen_links);
$total_seen_asins = count($seen_asins);
ps_log_error("Duplicate prevention summary: {$total_unique_products} unique products added, {$total_seen_links} unique links tracked, {$total_seen_asins} unique ASINs tracked");
```

### Expected Benefits

1. **Eliminated Duplicates**: No more duplicate products in cache or display
2. **Improved Performance**: Reduced processing time and memory usage
3. **Better User Experience**: Cleaner search results without duplicates
4. **Accurate Metrics**: Correct product counts and statistics
5. **Debugging Capability**: Clear logging of duplicate detection

### Monitoring and Verification

To verify the implementation is working:

1. **Check logs** for duplicate detection messages:
   - "Product X duplicate detected by ASIN: Y (skipping)"
   - "Puis-card product X duplicate detected by link: Y (skipping)"

2. **Look for summary statistics**:
   - "Duplicate prevention summary: X unique products added, Y unique links tracked, Z unique ASINs tracked"

3. **Compare before/after**:
   - Previous logs showed products appearing twice
   - New logs should show detection and skipping of duplicates

### Alternative Approaches Considered (and Why They're Less Optimal)

1. **Post-processing deduplication**: Would waste CPU cycles processing duplicates
2. **Checking only links**: Less reliable due to URL parameter variations
3. **Checking only ASINs**: Some products might not have ASINs
4. **Global deduplication in cache**: Too late, already wasted processing time

## Conclusion

This implementation provides efficient, real-time duplicate prevention that:
- Catches duplicates immediately during parsing
- Uses robust dual-detection (ASIN + normalized links)
- Provides comprehensive logging for monitoring
- Maintains optimal performance characteristics
- Ensures data integrity throughout the system

The solution addresses the core issue while adding minimal overhead and maximum reliability.

# Unit Price, Delivery Time, and Brand Parsing Updates

## Summary
Successfully reviewed and enhanced the parsing-test.php and parsing-test.js files with improved unit price, delivery time, and brand parsing logic, then applied all improvements to the main plugin.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Unit Price Parsing in `includes/amazon-api.php`
- **Location**: Lines 471-485 (main parsing function)
- **Location**: Lines 118-132 (alternative parsing function)
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed regex pattern from `/\/([\\d\\w\\s.]+)/` to `/\/([\d\w\s.]+)/` (removed double escaping)
  - Applied consistent unit price extraction logic across both parsing methods
  - Added proper unit price value calculation for sorting

### 2. Enhanced Delivery Time Parsing in `includes/amazon-api.php`
- **Location**: Lines 486-502 (main parsing function)  
- **Location**: Lines 133-149 (alternative parsing function)
- **Changes**:
  - **NEW**: Enhanced regex patterns to capture "FREE" in delivery time when present
  - **NEW**: Multiple extraction methods with priority: FREE+date, FREE only, date only, full text
  - Fixed regex patterns for better date matching
  - Removed duplicate/conflicting delivery time extraction code
  - Applied consistent delivery time extraction using `data-cy="delivery-recipe"` selector
  - Improved text concatenation and duplicate removal logic
  - **Examples**: Now captures "FREE delivery Wed, May 28" instead of just "Wed, May 28"

### 3. NEW: Advanced Brand Extraction in `includes/amazon-api.php`
- **Location**: Lines 450-485 (main parsing function)
- **Location**: Lines 170-185 (alternative parsing function)  
- **Changes**:
  - **NEW**: Multi-method brand extraction with 4 different approaches
  - **Method 1**: Standard brand selector (`a-size-base-plus` + `a-color-base`)
  - **Method 2**: Alternative brand selector in H2 elements
  - **Method 3**: Brand detection in sponsored sections with filtering
  - **Method 4**: Brand pattern extraction from product titles
  - **NEW**: Smart filtering to exclude prices, measurements, and non-brand text
  - **NEW**: Brand extraction method tracking for debugging
  - **Examples**: Now extracts brands like "Phyto", "Hanes", "Amy Coulee" etc.

### 4. Enhanced Alternative Parsing Function
- **Location**: `ps_try_alternative_parsing()` function
- **Changes**:
  - Added complete unit price extraction (was previously empty)
  - Added complete delivery time extraction with FREE detection (was previously empty)
  - **NEW**: Added complete brand extraction (was previously empty)
  - Added proper unit price value calculation for sorting
  - Made the fallback parsing method more robust

### 5. Enhanced Parsing Test Files
- **Location**: `includes/parsing-test.php` and `assets/js/parsing-test.js`
- **Changes**:
  - **NEW**: Enhanced brand extraction with same 4-method approach as main plugin
  - **NEW**: Enhanced delivery time extraction with FREE detection
  - **NEW**: Added extraction method tracking for debugging (brand_extraction_method, delivery_extraction_method)
  - **NEW**: Improved JavaScript display with color-coded extraction methods
  - **NEW**: Enhanced debugging information display
  - **NEW**: "FREE" highlighting in delivery time display

### 6. Removed Duplicate Code
- **Location**: Lines 552-558 (removed duplicate delivery time extraction)
- **Location**: Lines 594-602 (removed duplicate unit price processing)
- **Changes**:
  - Eliminated conflicting delivery time extraction methods
  - Removed duplicate unit price value calculation
  - Streamlined the parsing logic

## Key Improvements

### Unit Price Parsing
- **Before**: Inconsistent regex patterns, missing in alternative parsing
- **After**: Consistent extraction across all parsing methods
- **Format**: Extracts prices like "$3.99/100ml" correctly
- **Sorting**: Proper numeric value extraction for price-per-unit sorting

### Delivery Time Parsing  
- **Before**: Multiple conflicting extraction methods, inconsistent results, missing "FREE"
- **After**: Enhanced multi-pattern extraction with FREE detection using Amazon's data attributes
- **Format**: Extracts delivery info like "FREE delivery Wed, May 28" (preserving FREE when present)
- **Cleanup**: Removes duplicate text and formats consistently
- **Priority**: FREE+date > FREE only > date only > full text

### Brand Extraction (NEW)
- **Before**: Basic single-method extraction, often missed brands
- **After**: Advanced 4-method extraction with smart filtering
- **Methods**: Standard selectors, H2 elements, sponsored sections, title patterns
- **Filtering**: Excludes prices, measurements, delivery text, and other non-brand content
- **Examples**: Successfully extracts "Phyto", "Hanes", "Amy Coulee", "KÃ‰RASTASE", etc.
- **Debugging**: Tracks which method successfully extracted each brand

### Code Quality
- **Before**: Duplicate code blocks, inconsistent patterns
- **After**: Clean, maintainable code with consistent logic
- **Testing**: All changes verified with PHP syntax checking

## Files Modified
1. `includes/amazon-api.php` - Main parsing logic updates with brand extraction and FREE delivery detection
2. `includes/parsing-test.php` - Enhanced with improved brand and delivery time extraction
3. `assets/js/parsing-test.js` - Enhanced display with color-coded extraction methods and FREE highlighting
4. `PARSING_UPDATES_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Files Reviewed (No Changes Needed)
1. `assets/js/search.js` - Already handles unit price, delivery time, and brand correctly
2. `templates/search-form.php` - Already has proper display templates for all fields

## Testing
- PHP syntax validation passed for all modified files
- Parsing logic now matches the tested and working parsing-test.php implementation
- Frontend display logic already supports both unit price and delivery time fields

## Latest Updates (Applied)

### 7. Enhanced Alternative Parsing Function Brand Extraction
- **Location**: `ps_try_alternative_parsing()` function in `includes/amazon-api.php`
- **Changes**:
  - **FIXED**: Added missing Methods 2, 3, and 4 for brand extraction to match parsing-test.php
  - **NEW**: Added brand extraction method tracking (`$brand_extraction_method`)
  - **Method 2**: Alternative brand selector in H2 elements
  - **Method 3**: Brand detection in sponsored sections with filtering
  - **Method 4**: Brand pattern extraction from product titles
  - Now uses the complete 4-method approach consistently across all parsing functions

### 8. Fixed Unit Price Display Logic
- **Location**: `assets/js/search.js` - price per unit conditional handling
- **Changes**:
  - **FIXED**: Unit price now only displays when both `price_per_unit` AND `unit` exist and unit is not blank
  - **Before**: `if (item.price_per_unit)` - showed unit price even when unit was empty
  - **After**: `if (item.price_per_unit && item.unit && item.unit.trim() !== '')` - only shows when unit exists
  - **Result**: Prevents display of incomplete unit price information (e.g., "$3.99/" without the unit)

### 9. Enhanced Delivery Time Extraction for Multiple Options
- **Location**: `includes/amazon-api.php` (both main and alternative parsing functions)
- **Location**: `includes/parsing-test.php`
- **Changes**:
  - **NEW**: Enhanced delivery parsing to capture multiple delivery options from `data-cy="delivery-block"`
  - **NEW**: Extracts both primary delivery (`udm-primary-delivery-message`) and secondary delivery (`udm-secondary-delivery-message`)
  - **Format**: Now captures full delivery text like "FREE delivery Wed, May 28 on your first order\nOr fastest delivery Tomorrow, May 24"
  - **Fallback**: Still uses `data-cy="delivery-recipe"` if delivery-block not found
  - **Method Tracking**: Added `data_cy_delivery_block_multi` extraction method for debugging

### 10. Improved Product Layout and Delivery Display
- **Location**: `templates/search-form.php` - product template structure
- **Location**: `assets/js/search.js` - CSS styling
- **Changes**:
  - **FIXED**: Wrapped price and unit price in `.ps-product-pricing` container for better layout
  - **FIXED**: Removed "Delivery:" label prefix - now shows full delivery text directly
  - **FIXED**: Added `text-align: left` to ensure delivery time is left-aligned
  - **FIXED**: Added `white-space: pre-line` to preserve line breaks in multi-line delivery text
  - **RESULT**: Proper line breaks when no rating exists, clean delivery text display on multiple lines

## Result
The main plugin now uses enhanced parsing logic with significant improvements:

1. **Unit Price Extraction**: Consistent and reliable across all parsing methods
2. **Unit Price Display**: Only shows when complete (price + unit), prevents incomplete display
3. **Delivery Time Extraction**: Now preserves "FREE" when present and uses intelligent pattern matching
4. **Brand Extraction**: Advanced 4-method approach consistently applied across ALL parsing functions
5. **Alternative Parsing**: Now has complete brand extraction matching the main parsing function
6. **Debugging**: Enhanced tracking of extraction methods for better troubleshooting
7. **Testing Interface**: Improved parsing-test tool with color-coded results and better debugging information

These improvements should significantly enhance the accuracy and completeness of product data extraction from Amazon search results, providing users with more comprehensive product information including proper brand identification, complete delivery details, and clean unit price display.

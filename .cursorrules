This wordpress site is running from a docker container on a Synology NAS. The wp-content folder in 
which this plugin exists is mapped to an external folder using the docker volume 
'/volume1/docker/primates/wp-content:/var/www/html/wp-content:rw'. The development machine is running
windows 11 with the folder '/volume1/docker' mapped as 'x:'.

The plugin implements a smart proxy fallback system to minimize proxy costs and ensure reliability:
1. Primary use: proxy is used for development/testing when on configured network
2. fallback protection: if external IP's get blocked (503, 429, 403), automatically retry once with proxy
3. country-specific routing:  Amazon, ebay and Walmart use country specific poxy usernames 
to ensure correct geolocation and currency
4. character encoding: proper UTF-8 handling prevents display issues with international characters. This
strategy minimizes proxy costs while ensuring reliability for production users by only using the proxy
when necessary.

After making a change, test it in the browser at https://primates.life/shopper using Browser MCP. When testing platform specific changes ( eg. ebay), select the checkbox for that platform and deselect the other platforms, then click 'new search' if new data is needed from that platform. If new data isn't needed, then click 'filter' to test filtering changes, or click 'load more' to test loading changes. Once the platform-specific changes are confirmed to be correct, then test in combination with results from other platforms as needed by also selecting their checkboxes and performing new searches or filtering as needed.

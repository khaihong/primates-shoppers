It‚Äôs definitely on the longer side for a landing page, but not necessarily too wordy‚Äîit depends on your audience and goals. Here's a breakdown of what works well and what might benefit from trimming or restructuring:

### üëç What‚Äôs Strong
- **Clear value proposition**: ‚ÄúShop Smarter, Change the World‚Äù is punchy and inspiring.
- **Mission-driven messaging**: The idea of donating 80% of commissions to user-selected causes is compelling and differentiates your platform.
- **Emotional appeal**: Phrases like ‚ÄúBooo!‚Äù and ‚ÄúRevolutionary Revenue Sharing üí∞‚Äù add personality and help humanize the brand.
- **Feature highlights**: Smart search, filtering, and cause selection are clearly laid out.

### üõ† What Could Be Refined
- **Length and density**: The explanation about affiliate commissions and advertising revenue is informative but might overwhelm first-time visitors. Consider moving detailed info to a secondary page or collapsible section.
- **Tone consistency**: The mix of casual (‚ÄúBooo!‚Äù) and serious (‚Äú$364 Billion‚Ä¶‚Äù) is fun, but could be more balanced to maintain flow.
- **Call to action**: ‚ÄúStart Shopping & Supporting‚Äù is good, but could be more prominent and repeated throughout.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Suggested Edits
You might streamline the core message like this:

> **Shop Smarter, Change the World**  
> Find the best deals from top retailers like Amazon, eBay & Walmart‚Äîand support causes you care about with every purchase.  
> We donate 80% of our commissions to organizations chosen by our users.  
>  
> üîç Search smarter across multiple platforms  
> üí∞ Make your purchases count  
> ü§ù Support causes you believe in  
>  
> **Start Shopping & Supporting Today**

Then link to a ‚ÄúHow It Works‚Äù page for the deeper revenue-sharing explanation.

* Most large online retailers pay commissions to sites like this one for directing sales to them. But instead of pocketing the money, we will donate 80% of it to organizations that our users choose to support.

We would actually love to give 80% back to our users, but most affiliate contracts forbid doing so. Booo! So the next best thing is to support worthy causes, as decided by our users.

And that's just the beginning. As our community grows, we will soon be able to charge for advertising on this site, also. And then 80% of that revenue WILL go directly to our users who create content that attracts the advertising.
